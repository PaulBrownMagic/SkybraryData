Description
On 30 May 2003 a McDonnell Douglas MD-11F being operated by Gemini Air Cargo on a revenue flight from Brussels to New York JFK, made a late touchdown on 2560 m8,398.95 ft long runway 04R in normal night visibility and a runway overrun resulted. The aircraft entered the installed Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS) and stopped, sustaining only minor damage. The three occupants were uninjured.

Investigation
An Investigation was conducted by the NTSB. FDR data was available but the CVR had not been stopped after the accident and was of no use.
It was established that the aircraft commander had been PF and that an ILS approach had been flown. The aircraft had crossed the runway threshold slightly high but at about the correct speeds. In the presence of a slight tailwind, touchdown on the dry runway had not occurred until 768 m2,519.685 ft from the beginning of the runway. Autobrake and Autospoiler activation and thrust reverser deployment had occurred normally with the autobrakes set to minimum. When the PF realised that the end of the runway was approaching, manual braking was initiated but it was not possible to stop the aircraft on the paved surface. It exited the runway at an estimated ground speed of 30 knots before stopping in the EMAS with aircraft Nose Landing Gear 73 m 239.501 ft from the end of the runway.
The EMAS bed was set back  34 m111.549 ft from the end of the runway and had a length of  119 m390.42 ft. The aircraft stopped approximately  35 m114.829 ft into it.
The Investigation also noted that estimated landing weight had been 213 tonnes213,000 kg 469,584.618 lbs whereas the Company Operations Manual MLW for the runway and the aircraft as configured for the prevailing conditions including a 5 knot tail wind component was 205 tonnes205,000 kg 451,947.637 lbs.

Probable Cause
The NTSB adopted the following Probable Cause on 28 September 2005:
“The Captain's misjudgment of speed/distance which resulted in his failure to obtain the proper touch point resulting in an overrun".
Factors relevant to the outcome were considered to be the fact that it occurred at night and with a tail wind component.

Safety Recommendations
No safety recommendations were made as a result of this Investigation.
