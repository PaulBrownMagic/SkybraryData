Description
On 15 January 2009 during the landing roll at the Isle of Man in normal daylight visibility following a scheduled passenger flight from London City Airport, a Fokker F50 being operated by VLM left the side of the runway. 

Investigation
An Investigation carried out by the UK AAIB found that selection of a high reverse pitch setting whilst attempting to use rudder steering after touch down on a wet runway had led to a loss of directional control in the presence of a significant, but within-limits, cross wind component. It further established that appropriate standard operating procedures had not been followed. In particular, there was clear guidance in the VLM Operations Manual that for this aircraft type ‘The rudder is not effective for directional control with reverse’. No Safety Recommendations were made.
