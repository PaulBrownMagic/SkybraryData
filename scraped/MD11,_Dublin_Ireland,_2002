Description
On 3rd February 2002, a Delta Airlines MD-11 encountered a sudden exceptional wind gust (43 kts79.636 km/h 22.102 m/s) during the landing roll at Dublin, Ireland. The pilot was unable to maintain the directional control of the aircraft and a runway excursion to the side subsequently occurred.

Synopsis
This is the synopsis from the official report into the incident published by the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit:

"During its landing rollout on RWY 28 at EIDW, the MD 11, registered N803DE (Delta 129) started to initially drift towards the right and then slowly to the left-hand side of the runway.  Efforts by the Captain, the pilot-flying (PF), to counteract this drift through the application of full right rudder and right tiller failed, and the aircraft departed the paved surface into the prepared graded ground, which was rain soaked.  The Captain chose not to evacuate the passengers and crew through the emergency escape slides, preferring instead to wait for outside assistance and disembarkation by mobile stairs.  After approximately two hours, passengers and crew commenced disembarkation through the forward right-side (R2) cabin door and down the mobile stairs where they were immediately bussed to the terminal building. There were no reported injuries."
The Report states the cause of the accident to have been:

"The cause of the runway excursion was that the aircraft was subjected to an unexpected and sudden wind gust during the initial stages of the landing rollout, inducing a rate of yaw to the left, which could not be controlled by the pilot flying."
