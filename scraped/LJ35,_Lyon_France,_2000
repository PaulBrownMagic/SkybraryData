Description
On 2 May 2000, the crew of a GATES LEARJET Learjet 35 lost control of the aircraft, as a result of incorrect manual flying inputs, and crashed just before touchdown at Lyon, following an unstable single engine approach.

Synopsis
The following is extracted from the official report into the incident published by the BEA:
Summary:
"The Learjet 35A registered G-MURI was undertaking a flight between Farnborough and Nice. While in cruise at FL 390, it suffered a failure on the left engine. The crew decided to divert to Lyon-Satolas airport. The aircraft was guided on final approach to runway 36L by the ILS. On short final, when just over the runway threshold, the aircraft banked sharply to the left, the wing touched the ground and it crashed and caught fire.."
Conclusions:


 "â€¦While the aircraft was in cruise, the rupture of the No.5 bearing led to the failure of the left engine.

 The left engine was shut down, the crew declared a Mayday and undertook a descent followed by an approach on one engine.

 The approach, including its final phase, was never stabilised.

 Just before the runway threshold, a significant increase in thrust was commanded on the right engine.

 The aircraft banked sharply to the left and touched the ground with its left wing before crashing and catching fire."


Probable Cause:
"The accident resulted from a loss of yaw and then roll control which appears to be due to a failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine.
The hastiness exhibited by the Captain, and his difficulty in coping with the stress following the engine failure, contributed to this situation."
