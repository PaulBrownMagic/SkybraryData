Description
On 3 December 2005, the crew of a  MD-11 freighter failed to set the (very low) QNH for a night approach, due to distraction, and as a result descended well below the cleared altitude given by ATC for the intercept heading for the ILS at Nottingham East Midlands airport, UK.

Synopsis
The following is the Synopsis from the UK AAIB report:
"The incident occurred during an approach to Nottingham East Midlands Airport when the crew were distracted and omitted to set the arrival QNH of 974 mb on any of the three altimeters despite having acknowledged the setting to ATC. When the crew levelled at 2000 ft609.6 m, ATC questioned the aircraft’s pressure setting because the radar display indicated that the aircraft was much lower than cleared. At the time, the crew were visual with the approach lights."
