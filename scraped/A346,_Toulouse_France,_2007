Description
An Airbus A340-600, due to be delivered to Etihad Airways, was performing ground tests at the Airbus plant, Toulouse Airport in normal daylight visibility on 15 November 2007 with technical personnel in the pilot seats. The wheels were not chocked when the crew began engine and brake system testing. When the aircraft began to move with high thrust already set, the response of the two people in the flight deck was  inappropriate and a reduction in thrust was not actioned as a first response. The result was that the aircraft impacted and then mounted the concrete containment wall of the running bay causing the destruction of the aircraft and injury to all five occupants.

Investigation
Although no State Investigation was required under ICAO Annex 13, an independent investigation in accordance with similar procedures was requested from, carried out and subsequently published by the BEA
