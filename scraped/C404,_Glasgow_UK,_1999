Description
On 3rd September 1999, shortly after take-off from Glasgow UK, a Cessna 404 experienced an engine failure which was mishandled, leading to loss of control, and the aircraft was destroyed by a post-crash fire. 

Summary
The following is an extract of the Executive Summary from the official AAIB Report:
"…According to survivors, the take-off proceeded normally until shortly after the aircraft became airborne when they heard a thud or bang. The aircraft was seen by external witnesses at a low height, to the left of the extended centreline, in a wings level attitude that later developed into a right bank and gentle descent. Witnesses reported hearing an engine spluttering and saw at least one propeller rotating slowly. There was a brief "emergency" radio transmission from the commander and the aircraft was seen entering a steep right turn. It then entered a dive. A witness saw the wings levelled just before the aircraft struck the ground…Three survivors were helped from the wreckage…before flames from a severe post-impact fire engulfed the cabin.
The investigation identified the following causal factors:
The propeller of the failed engine was not feathered and therefore the aircraft was incapable of climbing on the power of one engine alone.
A total loss of thrust occurred once the left engine had failed and the right propeller had been feathered.
The commander attempted to return to the departure airfield but lost control of the aircraft during a turn to the right."
