Summary
On 9 May 2014, the crew of a Boeing 737-800 found that rotation during take off required significantly more back pressure on the control column than would be expected. It was found that a party of 87 primary school children all seated together at the rear of the cabin had been checked in as adults so that the aircraft had been up to 5 tonnes lighter and with a significantly different trim requirement than the certified and accepted loadsheet stated. The error was attributed to the inadequate group check arrangements of the airline involved.
