Description
On 19 March 2007, shortly after a night take off from Stansted UK and in VMC, the crew of a Lockheed Electra Freighter being operated by Atlantic Airways experienced control difficulties because of power fluctuation on all engines which were subsequently attributed to a malfunctioning propeller synchrophaser. The flight crew were unclear at the time what was occurring and proceeded to shut down one engine and believed that the others were at risk of failure during a return to land.

Synopsis
This is an extract from the report published by the AAIB, UK:
"Immediately after takeoff on a night flight from Stansted to Edinburgh, the flight crew experienced control difficulties and fluctuation of the rpm and power on all four engines. As the aircraft climbed towards 3,000 ft914.4Â m above mean sea level (QNH) the No 2 engine was observed to be running down. The crew shut the engine down, declared a PAN and prepared to return to Stansted. The remaining three engines continued to suffer from fluctuating parameters throughout the rest of the flight until, when on final approach with landing flap selected, both the No 1 and No 3 engines appeared to run down. The aircraft landed using only the No 4 engine. The investigation revealed that the incident was the result of a failure of the propeller synchrophaser."
