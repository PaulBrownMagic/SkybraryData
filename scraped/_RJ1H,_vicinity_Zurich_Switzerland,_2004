Description
On 31 October 2004, a Loss of Separation occurred between an A330-200, on a low go-around from Rwy 14 at Zurich Switzerland, and an Avro RJ100 which had been cleared for take-off on Rwy 10 and was on a convergent flight path.

The following is an extract from the official Swiss BFU report:
"On 31 October 2004, an Emirates Airbus A330-243 aircraft, operating under flight number UAE 87, was making an approach to runway 14 in Zurich. As it did so, immediately before landing it encountered turbulence caused by the north-easterly wind, resulting in an unstabilised final approach. The crew of UAE 87 therefore decided to go around shortly before touching down on the runway.
Immediately before this, the Swiss International Airlines Ltd. AVRO 146-RJ100 aircraft, operating under flight number SWR 162C, had been given take-off clearance from runway 10. After the air traffic control unit had noticed the go-around by UAE 87, SWR 162C was instructed to reject its take-off in order to avoid convergence of the two aircraft on their extended runway centrelines. SWR 162C rejected its take-off after the second instruction from the air traffic control unit, shortly before reaching decision speed V1. UAE 87 followed the published missed approach procedure and landed approximately 15 minutes later on runway 14 in Zurich."
