Description
On 28th December 1997, a Boeing 747, operated by United Airlines, which had departed from Tokyo heading for Hawaii, encountered severe turbulence thought to have been associated with a Jet Stream over the Pacific Ocean. 
Several passengers and crew members sustained serious injuries and one passenger subsequently died. Although Midway was possibly closer, the captain elected to return to Tokyo where the medical facilities were better. The aircraft did not sustain any structural damage but there was significant damage to fixtures and fittings in the cabin.
